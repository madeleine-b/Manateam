# ColorSchemed by Manateam (Madeleine Barowsky, Jamie Christy, Galen Chuang, Clare Pak, Ken Yeoh)

ColorSchemed is a Google Chrome extension for customizing the color scheme of elements and images of a page. From a pop-up menu, the user can choose a color to change from and a color to change to, as well as thresholds for each of the colors (or, how much the color is getting changed, and how much of range of colors there are). Then, the colors of the image(s) and page content will change. This allows careful customization of website colors to match user preferences.
